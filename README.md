1. Development of Python program in Data Science 
1.1. Data Collection: 
In practical scenario, data collection includes identify data sources, access to the source, 
gather data, data format, data organization, data documentation, ethical and privacy 
considerations. 
In this scenario, we have been already given collected sample datasets. 
Train, Test and Ideal 
1.2. Data Cleansing: 
This step involves the below steps. 
Handling Missing Data: Missing data refers to the absence of values for certain variables or 
attributes in the dataset. There are various techniques to handle missing data, such as 
deleting rows or columns with missing values, imputing missing values with statistical 
measures (mean, median, mode), or using more advanced methods like regression 
imputation or multiple imputation. 
Handling Outliers: Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from the normal 
distribution or expected patterns. Outliers can arise due to errors, measurement issues, or 
genuine extreme values. Depending on the analysis goals and the nature of the outliers, you 
can choose to remove outliers if they are errors or transform the data if the outliers represent 
meaningful information. 
Addressing Duplicate Data: Duplicate data refers to identical or very similar records that 
exist in the dataset. Duplicates can occur due to data entry errors, system glitches, or 
merging multiple datasets. To handle duplicates, you can either remove them from the 
dataset or merge them by aggregating values or selecting a representative record. 
Data Consistency and Standardization: Ensure that the data is consistent and follows a 
standard format throughout the dataset. This may involve correcting inconsistent spellings, 
formatting dates, converting units, or standardizing categorical variables. 
1.3. Data Analysis: 
In our case, Data analysis using the least squares method involved analysing a dataset to 
find the best-fitting line or curve that minimizes the sum of squared residuals. 
In general, it involves the below steps 
Exploratory data analysis: It is also known as EDA, is a statistical technique utilized to 
examine and describe the main characteristics of a dataset. This approach often involves 
employing visual methods, such as statistical graphics, to summarize and gain insights from 
the data. We also analyse and summarize the data to compute correlations, identify 
irregularities, and more Our task involved working with three sets of data i.e. "train", "test" 
and "ideal" all of which are in a .csv file format.. 
Model Estimation: Use Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, or scikit-learn to estimate the 
regression coefficients. Apply the least squares method to find the coefficients that minimize 
the sum of squared residuals. This step involves solving the normal equations or using 
matrix algebra to obtain the coefficients. However, our task did not involve forecasting or 
estimation. 
Model Evaluation: Assess the goodness of fit of the model to the data. Calculate metrics 
such as the coefficient of determination (R-squared), adjusted R-squared, and root mean 
squared error (RMSE) to evaluate the model's performance. These metrics indicate how well 
the model explains the variation in the dependent variable. 
In our case we established pairs to indicate which of the 50 functions can closely explain the 
function at hand and establish a similarity pair. 
1.4. Data Visualization: 
Data visualization is the graphical representation of data to provide insights, communicate 
patterns, trends, and relationships, and facilitate understanding of complex data. It involves 
using visual elements such as charts, graphs, maps, and infographics to present data in a 
visually appealing and meaningful way. Here are some key points about data visualization: 
Purpose: The purpose of data visualization is to make data more accessible and 
understandable, enabling users to quickly grasp patterns, trends, and outliers. It helps to 
simplify complex datasets and communicate information effectively. 
Types of Visualizations: There are various types of data visualizations, including: 
Bar charts and column charts ,Line charts ,Scatter plots, Pie charts, Heatmaps 
In this scenario, Line graph and Scatter plot is used to visualize the data 
Data visualization is often used as a storytelling tool, where data is presented in a narrative 
format to convey a specific message or highlight key insights. It involves structuring 
visualizations and accompanying explanations in a logical and compelling way to engage the 
audience and convey the intended story. 
2. Application of Least square method: 
The least squares method has various applications across different fields. Some of the 
common applications include: 
Linear Regression: The least squares method is widely used in linear regression analysis, 
where it is used to estimate the parameters of a linear relationship between a dependent 
variable and one or more independent variables. It helps in finding the best-fit line that 
minimizes the sum of squared residuals. 
Financial Analysis: In finance, the least squares method is used to analyze and model 
financial data. It can be used to estimate asset pricing models, such as the Capital Asset 
Pricing Model (CAPM), to determine the expected return on an investment based on its risk. 
Time Series Analysis: The least squares method is applied in time series analysis to model 
and forecast trends and patterns in sequential data. It helps in identifying the underlying 
patterns and making predictions based on historical data. 
Econometrics: Econometric models often utilize the least squares method to estimate the 
parameters of economic relationships. It helps in analysing and understanding the 
relationships between economic variables and their impact on various economic outcomes. 
Quality Control: The least squares method can be used in quality control to analyse and 
optimize manufacturing processes. It helps in identifying the relationship between process 
variables and product quality, allowing for process improvement and optimization. 
Image Processing: In image processing and computer vision, the least squares method can 
be used for image reconstruction, denoising, and image compression. It helps in finding the 
best approximation of the original image based on a set of observed data points. 
Geodesy and Surveying: The least squares method is extensively used in geodesy and 
surveying to estimate unknown parameters and adjust measurements. It helps in 
determining accurate positions and coordinates of points on the Earth's surface. 
These are just a few examples of the applications of the least squares method. Its versatility 
and wide range of applications make it a fundamental tool in data analysis, modelling, and 
prediction in various disciplines. 
3. Research topic: sqlalchemy and its applications on python 
SQLAlchemy is a popular Python library that provides a flexible and powerful toolkit for 
working with relational databases. It simplifies the process of interacting with databases, 
allowing developers to focus on their application's logic rather than the intricacies of SQL 
queries. In this essay, we will explore SQLAlchemy and its applications in Python. 
3.1. Introduction to SQLAlchemy: 
SQLAlchemy is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that provides a high-level, 
Pythonic interface for working with databases. It abstracts the database operations and 
allows developers to interact with databases using Python objects and methods, making 
database access more intuitive and efficient. 
3.2. Key Features of SQLAlchemy:

and database rows to instances of those classes, allowing developers to work with 
databases using familiar object-oriented programming techniques. 
Database Abstraction: SQLAlchemy supports multiple database backends, including popular 
ones like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Oracle. This allows developers to write 
database-agnostic code and switch between databases without rewriting their application 
logic. 
SQL Expression Language: SQLAlchemy provides a powerful SQL Expression Language, 
which allows developers to construct complex SQL queries using Pythonic syntax. It 
provides a high-level, composable API for building queries, making it easier to write and 
maintain complex database queries. 
Connection Pooling: SQLAlchemy includes built-in connection pooling, which helps manage 
and reuse database connections efficiently, improving performance and scalability. 
Transactions and Data Integrity: SQLAlchemy supports transactions, allowing developers to 
perform atomic operations on the database. It ensures data integrity by providing features 
like rollback and commit, making it easy to handle data modifications consistently. 
3.3. Applications of SQLAlchemy in Python: 
Web Development: SQLAlchemy is commonly used in web development frameworks like 
Flask and Django. It simplifies database interactions, allowing developers to define database 
models as Python classes and perform database operations using ORM methods. This 
enhances productivity and reduces the need for writing complex SQL queries manually. 
Data Analysis and Manipulation: SQLAlchemy integrates well with other data analysis 
libraries like Pandas and NumPy. It allows developers to query databases, retrieve data, 
perform aggregations, and manipulate data using familiar data analysis techniques. 
Data Migration and Schema Management: SQLAlchemy provides powerful tools for 
managing database schemas and performing data migrations. Developers can easily define 
database schemas using Python classes and use SQLAlchemy's migration tools to handle 
schema changes smoothly. 
Data Integration and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): SQLAlchemy can be used to integrate 
data from multiple sources, transform it into a desired format, and load it into a target 
database. It provides a unified interface for working with different databases, making data 
integration tasks more efficient. 
3.4. Conclusion: 
SQLAlchemy is a versatile and powerful library for working with databases in Python. Its
